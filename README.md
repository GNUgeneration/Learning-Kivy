# Learning-Kivy

This repo is for me to learn Kivy.

I took the Flappy Bird code samples from Richard Jones, at his video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U14P8gtjQmU

and his code : https://bitbucket.org/r1chardj0n3s/kivy-game-tutorial/src/a8275f381cd74b1b17033351bae5dadc50c0daf8/flappy/?at=master

I took the Flappy Ship Part 1 code from the website: https://kivyspacegame.wordpress.com/2014/06/20/flappy-ship-a-step-by-step-game-tutorial-part-1/
